# Trigger-Launcher

This repository contains the sources for the *Trigger-Launcher* app, which
serves as an extension to the *Live-Triggering* pre-production tool and can
optionally be used with a *StreamDeck* device. Because it interacts with
hardware, it is a desktop application based on the Electron framework.

## Installation

In order to configure the application, make sure you have *Yarn* and *Webpack*
installed. Once you've done so, navigate to the project root and run

```
yarn install
```

This will install all project dependencies. Once complete, the application
sources need to be transpiled. To do that, run

```
webpack
```

If this step completes without errors, you're ready to actually launch the
application. In development mode, this is done as follows:

```
yarn start
```

## Configuration

Runtime configuration options for the application are read from the file
`config.json` located in the project root. When running the application on
your local machine, you should update the option `serverUrl` to point to a
running instance of the pre-production application, i.e. the pre-production
application (or trigger-tool) you want to interact with.

Note that starting from version 1.2.0, the `serverUrl` can also be changed
dynamically in the starting screen of the application.
